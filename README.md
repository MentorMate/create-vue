TODO - Update github related stuff when transferred

This is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue">create-vue</a>, where we are extending its existing functionality while keeping it up to date with the original repository. Feel free to contribute and help make this project even better!

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, build, and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-cli-bootstrap.git
cd vite-cli-bootstrap
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have <a href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</a> installed, as we'll be using it for package management.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will generate the build output in the outfile.cjs file.

### 4. Run the Project

You can now use the built CLI by running the following command, replacing <path-to-build-file> with the actual path to the outfile.cjs file:

```bash
npx <path-to-build-file>
```
